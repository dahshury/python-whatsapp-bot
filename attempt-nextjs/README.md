# My WhatsApp Bot Calendar Frontend

This is the Next.js frontend for the WhatsApp Bot reservation system.

## Development

### Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Error Recovery & Troubleshooting

If you encounter JavaScript bundle corruption errors like "Invalid or unexpected token" after the development server has been running for a while, use these recovery commands:

#### Basic Recovery
```bash
# Clean build cache and restart
npm run dev:clean
```

#### Full Reset
```bash
# Complete reset (clears cache and reinstalls dependencies)
npm run dev:reset
```

#### Manual Cleanup
```bash
# Clean all build artifacts and caches
npm run clean
```

#### During Development
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` in browser for automatic error recovery
- The app includes automatic error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Bundle corruption is automatically detected and recovery is attempted

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid or unexpected token" errors**: Usually caused by HMR bundle corruption
   - Solution: Use `npm run dev:clean` or refresh the page
   
2. **Calendar skeleton not loading**: Check browser console for detailed error info
   - Solution: Error boundary will show recovery options
   
3. **Hot reload not working**: Clear Next.js cache
   - Solution: `npm run dev:clean`

bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
