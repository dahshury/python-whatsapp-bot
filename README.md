This project is a WhatsApp bot built using FastAPI, integrated with OpenAI and Anthropic for generating intelligent responses for customers using Whatsapp API, and includes a Streamlit frontend for managing reservations and managing bookings into a SQLite database. The bot allows users to make, modify, and cancel reservations via WhatsApp, while the front-end Streamlit application provides a graphical interface for managing reservations and customers messages. The project is designed to be easily deployable on various platforms, including AWS and Heroku.

For the original repository and setup torial (Flask version), please refer to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/python-whatsapp-bot).

This project is a WhatsApp bot built using FastAPI, integrated with OpenAI for generating intelligent responses, and includes a Streamlit frontend for managing reservations and visualizing data into a SQLite database. The bot allows users to make, modify, and cancel reservations via WhatsApp, with the assistance of AI for natural language understanding.

## Overall Operation

The application operates as follows:

1. **Webhook Handling**:
   - The FastAPI application in `views.py` listens for incoming webhooks from WhatsApp at the `/webhook` endpoint.
   - Incoming requests are verified using the `verify_signature` decorator from `security.py` to ensure authenticity.

2. **Message Processing**:
   - When a message is received, it is parsed in `openai_service.py` via the `process_whatsapp_message` function.
   - The `openai_service.py` module uses OpenAI's API to generate an intelligent response based on the message content.

3. **Database Interactions**:
   - The application uses SQLite, managed by `db.py`, to store data such as conversation history, reservation details, and thread information.
   - Tables include `threads`, `conversation`, `reservations`, and `cancelled_reservations`.

4. **Reservation Management**:
   - Users can interact with the bot via WhatsApp to make, modify, or cancel reservations.
   - The `assistant_functions.py` module handles these operations, updating the database accordingly.

5. **Utility Functions**:
   - Functions in `utils/service_utils.py` and `utils/whatsapp_utils.py` assist with tasks like sending WhatsApp messages, parsing dates/times, and managing threads.

6. **Frontend**:
   - The Streamlit application in `app/frontend/dashboard.py` provides a graphical interface to:
      - Visualize the reservation calendar.
      - Manage reservations (create, update, delete).
      - View conversation histories.
      - Send manual messages via WhatsApp.
   - Authentication is handled in `frontend/__init__.py` using `streamlit_authenticator`. The credentials are stored in `users.yaml`. For more details, refer to [Streamlit Authenticator documentation](https://github.com/mkhorasani/Streamlit-Authenticator).

7. **Automated Reminders**:
   - A background scheduler (APS cheduler) in the FastAPI app runs daily at midnight to automatically send appointment reminders via WhatsApp.

8. **Automated Database Backup**:
   - The `sqlite_backup.sh` script creates a backup of the SQLite database to a remote google drive folder.



## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the application:

## AI WhatsApp Bot Setup Guide

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-whatsapp-bot.git
cd ai-whatsapp-bot
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `example.env` and update the necessary variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
- `OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID`: Your OpenAI Assistant ID.
- `VEC_STORE_ID`: Vector store ID for OpenAI retrieval.
- `ACCESS_TOKEN`: WhatsApp API access token.
- `PHONE_NUMBER_ID`: WhatsApp phone number ID.
- `VERIFY_TOKEN`: Webhook verification token.
- `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET`: Meta app credentials.
- `BUSINESS_LATITUDE`, `BUSINESS_LONGITUDE`, `BUSINESS_NAME`, `BUSINESS_ADDRESS`: Business location details.
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT`: System prompt for Anthropic.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key.

## 4. Run the FastAPI Application

```bash
python run.py
```

Runs on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` by default.

## 5. Run the Streamlit Frontend

```bash
streamlit run app/frontend/dashboard.py
```

Access at `http://localhost:8501` (default Streamlit port).

## 6. Set Up Webhooks

Configure the WhatsApp webhook to point to your FastAPI application's `/webhook` endpoint (e.g., via `ngrok` for local testing).

## 7. Automated Reminders

- No additional setup is required: reminders are sent automatically by the FastAPI background scheduler at the configured timezone (midnight by default).
  
  *Tip:* You can still run `scripts/send_reminders.py` manually for ad‑hoc reminders if needed.

## 8. Set Up Reminders (Optional)

Run `send_reminders.py` and sqlite_backup.sh manually or schedule them (e.g., via `cron`) to send reminders and back up the database:

```bash
python send_reminders.py
```

```bash
sqlite_backup.sh
```

## Usage

### WhatsApp Bot

- Once the FastAPI application is running and webhooks are configured, the bot responds automatically to messages received on the configured WhatsApp number.
- Users can send commands to manage reservations (e.g., book, modify, cancel).

### Streamlit Frontend

- Access at `http://localhost:8501`.
- Log in with credentials defined in `users.yaml`.
- View and manage reservations, visualize conversation histories, and send manual WhatsApp messages.

### Reminders
